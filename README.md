# Final Assessment

## Tasks

1. Provide the output of the flow module & a brief explanation

2. Implement a method that calculates flow volume, assuming constant rainfall and plot the resultant data

3. Repeat task 2 but use non-constant rainfall rather than assuming a constant rainfall.

4. Improve the flow algorithm - the water needs to flow into the sea / exit the landscape.

5. Get the code to work with real data: 
    a.) Calculate the maximum flow rate in the DEM 
    b.) Calculate the location of the maximum flow rate

6. Write a discussion about the limitations of the code
